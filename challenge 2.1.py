#Implement a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class should have private attributes for account number, account holder name, and account balance. Include methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and display the account balance. Ensure that the account balance cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Write a program to create an instance of the BankAccount class and test the deposit and withdrawl functionality.

class BankAccount:

  def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder_name, initial_balance = 0.0):
    self.__account_number = account_number
    self.__account_holder_name = account_holder_name
    self.__account_balance = initial_balance

  def deposit(self, amount):
   if amount > 0:
      self.__account_balance += amount
      print(end="\n")
      print("Deposited â‚¹{}. New balance: â‚¹{}".format(amount, self.__account_balance))

   else:
     print(end="\n")
     print("Invalid deposit amount. Please deposit a positive amount.")

  def withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__account_balance:
     self.__account_balance -= amount
     print(end="\n")
     print("Withdrew â‚¹{}. New balance: â‚¹{}".format(amount,self.__account_balance))

    else:
      print("Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient balance.")
  
  def display_balance(self):
    print(end="\n")
    print("Account balance for {} (Account #{}): â‚¹{}".format(
              self.__account_holder_name, self.__account_number, self.__account_balance))


#Create an instance of the BankAccount class
account = BankAccount(account_number="123456789", account_holder_name="Nilofer", initial_balance=5000.0)

#Test deposit and withdrawl functionality
d=int(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
print(end="\n")
w=int(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
account.display_balance()
account.deposit(d)
account.withdraw(w)
account.display_balance()
